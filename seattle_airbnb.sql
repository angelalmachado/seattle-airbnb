They do have a couple other rooms that had other airbnbers occupying it at the time and the room next door to us was occupied by a family member. The room is very roomy and plenty of space as well as the restroom.

I was looking for accommodation as close as possible to a hotel, and this fit the bill. Guests enter through a separate door, so if you dont want to exchange pleasantries with your host or run into other guests, you wont here. It is very private and youre given a key upon arrival, so you can feel free to come and go as you please. My room (the suite) was very comfortable and had its own bathroom with shower. Amenities in the room included a TV, microwave, small fridge, robe, noise machine for sleeping and fan/heater. I asked for a hair dryer to be dropped off and they were very accommodating; you can simply ring them up if there are any problems. The house was quiet, and I got three good nights sleep. The only thing to be aware of is that there is not an external lock on the doors for when you leave (you can lock yourself in when youre in the room, however). This was not a problem for me, but be aware of this incase you travel with expensive technology or are particularly cautious. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to others -- thanks, Jess and Joey!');

We had a rental so it was nice to have secure parking in the building. The rest of the amenities of the building were amazing. I absolutely fell in love with the rooftop deck. My only complaint about the unit was that there was a strange smell possibly coming from the garbage disposal, which may have been from the tenants before us.

Kind of misleading. Kitchen, dining and living area are open consept and space is efficiently used. Kitchen has modern stainless appliances and stocked well.  When the sleeper sofa is open it takes up the entire living room area.  Otherwise the unit Sleeps 6 comfortably but only has one bathroom so trying to get 6 adults showered in a timely fashion is difficult. Also is not airconditioned but Seattle is usually a temperate climate. We just happened to visit during an unusually hot heat spell. They did provide fans for each bedroom and for the small living room.dining area.  Open windows provided loud street noise :-(  The recreation room is on the main level and does not provide a pool table as it is advertised. Not very clean area and open to anyone entering the building so not very private. Rooftop grilling area is nice but be cautious and careful because renters bring their dogs up to roof to do their duties. An area with artificial turf is provided for the dogs on the rooftop for the apartment complex. As for location : Excellent, we were able to walk to all venues.  Pikes Market place, Chihully art exhibit a must see. Underground Seattle was a must do, Pioneer square has great shops, and many very good restaurants within walking distance. Be sure to bring walking shoes, Seattle is very hilly, similar to San Francisco. Very easy to contact Darik with any concerns.  Also contact between Darik before trip was appreciated and never felt we were forgotten. Loved Seattle area. Will return again. Would definitely reserve this unit again but not for 6 people, 4 people max would be more comfortable.');
